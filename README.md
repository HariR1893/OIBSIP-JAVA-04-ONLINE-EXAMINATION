# Online Examination System

The Online Examination System is a Java Swing-based project developed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. This system allows users to conduct online examinations with the following key functionalities:

- **Login:** Users can log in with their credentials to access the system.
- **Update Profile and Password:** Users can update their profile information and change their passwords.
- **Selecting Answers for MCQs:** Users can answer multiple-choice questions presented during the examination.
- **Timer and Auto Submit:** The system features a timer that counts down the time left for the examination. It automatically submits the answers when the timer expires.
- **Closing Session and Logout:** Users can close their examination sessions and log out of the system.

## Technologies Used

- Java Swing: The graphical user interface (GUI) was built using Java Swing.
- Java SE: The project is developed in Java SE (Standard Edition).
